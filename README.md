# minst-digit-classifier
A MNIST digit classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on 80% of the MNIST dataset and validated on the remaining 20%. The architecture consists of three convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions, followed by one fully connected (dense) layer with 10 output units to classify digits from 0 to 9
